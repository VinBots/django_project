CO2 equivalent (CO2e)
The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential (GWP) of each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to evaluate releasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse gases against a common basis.

Indirect emissions: Emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the reporting company, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another company.
Direct emissions: Emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting company.
Greenhouse gases (GHG): GHG: For the purposes of this standard, GHGs are the six gases covered by the UNFCCC: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
Scope 1 emissions: Emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by the reporting company.
Scope 2 emissions: Emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating or cooling consumed by the reporting company.
Scope 3 emissions: All indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.
Supply Chain: A network of organizations (e.g., manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) involved in the production, delivery, and sale of a product to the consumer.
Value Chain emissions: Emissions from the upstream and downstream activities associated with the operations of the reporting company.

SBTi:
« The use of offsets is not counted as reductions toward the progress of companies’ science-based targets. The SBTi requires that companies set targets based on emission reductions through direct action within their own boundaries or their value chains. Offsets are only considered to be an option for companies wanting to contribute to finance additional emission reductions beyond their science-based target/net-zero »
