            <hr/><b>What are the objectives of Net0Tracker.org?</b><br>

            Net0Tracker tracks the climate performance of major companies by focusing on 3 main areas:

            <li>reporting <b>transparency</b></li>
            <li>greenhouse gas reduction <b>commitments</b></li>
            <li>actual <b>results</b></li>

            Companies have a major role to play in the fight against climate change. Over the past 2 years, we have
            observed a significant acceleration in carbon reduction commitments (science-based targets, net zero, carbon
            neutrality...) but, in the absence of regulation and widely-adopted standards, it remains very challenging
            for the general public to understand which company is serious and truly delivers on its commitments. A
            majority of employees and consumers care about climate commitments but few information exist to truly
            differentiate greenwashing from serious companies.
            Net0Tracker.org aims at improving transparency and keeping companies accountable on their climate
            commitments.

            There is also a lack of public and freely-available climate-related data on carbon emissions of major
            companiesa as most data providers sell their services to investors and portfolio managers. We consider
            climate data as a public good and essential to manage the climate crisis in the coming years. By publishing
            climate data, Net0Tracker.org hopes to contribute to democratize the use of climate data at scale and
            encourage companies to improve reporting accuracy, completeness and timeliness.


            <hr/><b>How do you ensure data quality?</b><br>

            Data quality is a major challenge for 2 reasons: most climate data live in PDF files, on the website of
            companies or sold by data providers; there are also inconsistencies across different sources (CDP data
            sometimes differ from public data). 2 main strategies are adopted to ensure data quality:
            * compare data sources. For example, Net0Tracker.org analyses both CDP data and public data. In case of more
            than 5% discrepancy on a similar emission scope or category, CDP data is preferred (most data on
            sustainability reports of companies are rounded). When data is only available in one data source, we use
            this single source. For example, a lot of companies do not publish unverified data, like some scope 3
            emissions categories. CDP data is used in case the company reports its scope 3 emissions to CDP only.
            * document data acquisition: every data is fully documented. These documents will be made available on
            Net0Tracker.org, which will support data verification. It is particularly useful to document changes over
            time as some emissions calculations (especially scope 3 and sometimes scope 2 because of REC accounting)
            tend to be updated retroactively.

            <hr/><b>What is the scoring methodology?</b><br>

            The scoring methoology will be documented here. We are open to feedbacks and suggestions to improve it.
            Please feel free to contact us.

            <hr/><b>Do you intend to scale to other companies in the US and internationally?</b><br>

            Yes, this is the grand vision after stabilizing the scoring methodology and testing the public appetite for
            more data and analysis.

            <br><b>Do companies have a right to comment their scores?</b><br>
            Yes and it is strongly encouraged. The scoring methodology is a very data-driven approach that aims at
            benchmarking all the companies independently from their sector. We welcome providing additional context that
            will enrich the understanding of the relative climate performance of the companies. There may be some errors
            in data or changes in perimeter (especially in baseline figures, in case of acquisitions or disposals) -
            companies are strongly encouraged to ask for corrections if necessary.
