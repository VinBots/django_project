        I am French, 41 and work for a major energy mutlinational company (ENGIE), as the Chief Financial Officer of its 
        <a
            href="https://www.engieimpact.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">sustainability consulting arm (ENGIE Impact)</a>. For many years, my goal has been to better connect finance with sustainability.
        During summer 2021, after reading a <a
            href="https://cbey.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2021-01/CBEY_NET-ZERO-FINAL_Jan2021.pdf" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Yale University</a> and observing some great initiatives from data
        scientists to track COVID cases, I embarked on a personal (crazy) project and studied the sustainability reporting of the top
        100 largest US companies. I created this website after realizing that there was a lack of clear benchmarking of
        the environmental
        performance of companies whereas the number of net zero claims have exploded in the past 2 years. Even if it is
        incredibly challenging to distinguish real ambitions from marketing campaign (what our industry calls
        'greenwashing'), it is possible.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I hope this website can contribute to better understand net zero claims and encourage companies to better
        disclose their carbon footprint and take actions for real to fight against climate change.
