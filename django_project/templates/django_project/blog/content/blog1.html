        <h2>The Vision</h3>
            <p>
            <h3>Net0Tracker tracks the climate performance of major companies with a vision that climate data should be
                a
                public good</h3> <br><br>
                The climate change equation to avoid catastrophic consequences is well-known : cut our greenhouse gas
                (GHG) emissions by half by
                2030 and reach net zero by 2050. In the corporate world, the sharp decline in direct and indirect GHG
                emissions must happen now, in our everyday actions, our business models, our decision-making rationale
                and
                our incentives mechanisms. Over the past 2 years, the increase of net zero commitments and science-based
                targets has been encouraging but the sense of urgency must increase with concrete actions and better
                accountability. <br><br>
                Even in the absence of regulation, carbon must now be managed with the <b>same discipline as
                    finance</b>,
                especially in terms of transparency, completeness, verification, standardization and accuracy.
                I created Net0Tracker as an attempt to simply represent the level of <b>transparency, commitments and
                    actions</b>
                of major corporates beyond marketing campaigns and participation in task forces or working groups.
                Like COVID-related data, climate data should be considered as a <b>public good</b> in order to trigger
                more
                collaboration and transparency. I observe that there is a lack of publicly-available aggregated
                information
                about GHG emissions of companies. <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">CDP</a> does not make its data
                open-source and many private data providers
                (e.g. MSCI, Trucost, Bloombergâ€¦) are mainly selling their data and analysis to investors and portfolio
                managers. On
                top of it, emissions inventory and reporting are still a painful process which causes climate data
                to be released very late (
                generally 7-8 months after year-close) and challenging to track on a timely basis. 
                I hope that Net0Tracker will encourage companies to better disclose their climate
                performance
                and implement best-in-class practices. <br><br>
