        <h2>Value Chain Emissions are Significantly Under-Reported</h2>

        <p>If ony the consumers could get in the game... before the regulator

            In the previous blog, we saw that only 1 out of 6 companies are fully transparent in their
            carbon emission reporting, even if about 4 out of 5 companies report scope 1-2 and a part of scope 3
            emissions. The real game-changer is the full transparency on value chain (scope 3) emissions but today,
            I estimate that only 44% companies report all scope 3 emissions and only 16% get them fully verified by
            an external third-party. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Reporting value chain GHG emissions, both upstream (supply chain) and downstream (end-use), remains a
            major challenge for most corporates, in terms of data availability, accuracy, consistency, frequency and
            completeness. However, value chain emissions usually represent more than 80% total GHG emissions with
            some sectors well-above 90% (for example, 98% in consumer discretionary, 95% in financial services, 94%
            in consumer staples).
            MSCi recently published a study with similar findings (<a
                href="https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/climate-investing/net-zero-tracker">MSCI Net Zero
                Tracker</a>), that shows the emissions intensity by scope and
            by sector and also tracks the progress in scope 3 reporting.

            </div>
        </div>


        <p>Among companies reporting some scope 3 emissions, I estimate that about 2/3 scope 3 emissions are omitted on
            average. The chart below helps visualize the gap by sector. </p>

        <h3>Value Chain Emissions Represent more than 85% of total emissions (vs. 66% are currently reported)</h3>
        <p>The left chart represents the weight of emissions by scope for companies fully disclosing their emissions. On
            average, value chain (scope 3) emissions represent 85% total emissions.
            <br>
            The right chart represents the same as left chart but for all the companies, including those not fully
            reporting their emissions. Comparing the 2 charts enable to visualize the under-reported emissions by sector
        </p>

        <div class="row">

            <div align="center" class="col-6 col-12-medium">

                <img src="{% static 'django_project/images/charts/general/real_scope_heatmap.jpeg' %}"
                    class="image featured" alt="" />
                <p style="text-align:left"><b>Note: </b> Only S&P 100 companies (44%) fully disclosing their scope 3
                    emissions are selected.
                </p><br>

            </div>

            <div align="center" class="col-6 col-12-medium">

                <img src="{% static 'django_project/images/charts/general/reported_scope_heatmap.jpeg' %}"
                    class="image featured" alt="" />
                <p style="text-align:left"><b>Note: </b> Based on all scope 3 emissions reported by S&P 100 companies
                </p><br>

            </div>

        </div>

        <p>

            Yet, assessing the completeness of scope 3 emissions sounds like a judgement call. The relevance of
            scope 3 categories depends on the type of activities and even if <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDP</a> requires justification for every
            category of scope 3 emissions (section C6 of CDP questionnaire), companies within the same sector tend to
            have different
            approach or rationale to exclude some categories. This scope 3 completeness issue highlights the need
            for stronger sectorial guidance, methodologies and reporting framework standards specifically focused on
            scope 3
            emissions. For example, banks tend not to report on scope 15 - Investments because of lack of
            widely-recognized methodologies; 3M does an excellent job at reporting their emissions but faces
            understandable challenges to report on product-level emissions (+50,000 products with various end-use);
            tech companies like Amazon and Apple are merging some scope 3 categories (IP reasons?).

            In summary: scope 3 emissions are significantly under-reported but there is hope as many companies are
            leading the way in adopting new tools and methodologies to not only demonstrate transparency but also
            disclose and optimize the full carbon footprint of their products and services. In terms of timing, I
            wish the consumers would get in the game before the regulators!
