        <h2>Is the creation of ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) a real game-changer in ESG reporting?</h2>

                    YES, for several reasons:<br>
                    
                    ✅ It merges several major standards, like SASB, IIRC and CDSB. That signals the end of "Alphabet soup"
                    <br>✅ It deepens the integration of financial and sustainability information to inform investment decisions. Good news for the market and CFOs!
                    <br>✅ The early published prototype on climate signals wide adoption of TCFD principles and recognition that climate risks require initiatives at the right speed and at global scale. Companies should continue their efforts in adopting TCFD.
                    
                    <br><br>What’s next?
                    <br>🔧GRI and ISSB will have to collaborate in the coming months and solve their philosophical divergence.
                    <br>📝First ISSB standards to be published by end-2022.
                    <br>📆 The US SEC is expected to impose climate reporting requirements by end-2021.
                    <br>🔍 Corporates will continue to reinforce their governance and monitoring of sustainability-related risks.
