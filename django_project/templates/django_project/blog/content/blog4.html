        <h2>3 Major Challenges to Trust Carbon Data</h2>

        <p> Exploring GHG emissions data in a ESG or sustainability report is a very similar experience to reading
            financials in an annual report: it is technical, full of footnotes, appendix, references to frameworks (e.g.
            CDP, GRI, SASB, TCFD...) and external documents. Like finance, the language makes it hardly accessible to
            non-experts.
            A major difference with financial reporting is the level of verification and regulation. For non-financial
            data, we often talk about assurance, not audit, to name the verification process of disclosures. In the
            absence of regulation, many assurance providers have adopted various standards, such as ISO14064-3, ISAE
            3000, AICPA, AA100 or proprietary methodology. This naturally leads to a lack of consistency and
            comparability across companies. <br>

        <p>Today, I see 3 major issues in carbon emissions data reporting:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Partial disclosures is not good enough</b>: Very few companies (1 out of 6) get value chain or scope 3 emissions
                verified, which
                usually represent more than 80% total emissions.</li>
            <li><b>Third-party verification is too light</b>: The vast majority (>90%) of assurance statements are 'limited', a type
                of
                'negative' assurance, which means that it is expressed in a negative form. For example, in a limited
                assurance, the assurer states that it did not find evidence that data is materially incorrect. Not really
                re-assuring.</li>
            <li><b>Performance reporting is not rigorous enough</b>: performance against targets are rarely verified,
                some past
                period data and GHG emissions baselines can be modified without additional verification and restatements
            </li>
        </ul>



        <b>What's next?</b> In the US, regulation is expected to strengthen reporting requirements for major companies. All
        the eyes are now on the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) that launched a public consultation
        about climate change disclosures in Q1 with the objective to provide guidance about new climate reporting
        requirements and standards by end of 2021. On top of more regulation, we will also need to strengthen
        standards, mainly on scope 3 reporting (e.g. sectorial approach) and emissions reduction claims (e.g.
        criteria for net zero claims). Many initiatives, like
        <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCFD</a>,
        <a href="https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCAF</a> and
        <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/net-zero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBTi net zero
            standard</a>, will undoubtedly support this movement and make carbon reporting more trustworthy.
