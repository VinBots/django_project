            New York, June 2022 - One year ago, I started analyzing the climate performance of
            the top 100 American companies by scanning through their website, sustainability reporting, CDP
            disclosures, verification report and updates about their progress to date.
            I added additional data points from MSCi (<a
                href="https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/climate-investing/net-zero-solutions/implied-temperature-rise"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implied Temperature Rise</a>) and SBTi with the
            objective to calculate a global climate performance score that
            balances transparency (30%), commitments
            (40%) and results (30%). See methodology <a href="{% url 'faq' %}">here</a> (note that the scores will be
            updated
            after completing all the reviews by early July 2022.).
            <br>
        <p>Over the past 3 months, many sustainability reports were released to the public. Here's my first
            observations on 2022 Climate Reporting:
            <br>
        </p>
        <br>üìâ<b>Focus is clearly shifting from aspirational goals and compliance to analysis of progress against
            targets.</b> We also observe much fewer new targets in 2021/2022. This is consistent with the SBTi project
        to better measure progress against stated targets (see <a
            href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/reports/sbti-progress-report-2021" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">SBTI PROGRESS REPORT 2021</a>)

        <br>üìà<b>More companies report on their climate performance</b> with also better transparency, dedicated
        resources
        on often revamped sustainability section of corporates websites and much better explanations about methodology,
        key figures (providing a full 'ESG data table' seems like a best practice) and alignement with other reporting
        frameworks (e.g.
        CDP, GRI,
        TCFD...).
        <br>üîç<b>Better control: </b>the level of third-party external assurance on GHG emissions disclosures
        tends
        to
        increase, with more
        companies moving from limited to reasonable assurance (mainly over scope 1 and 2).

        <br>üîì<b>Still too many restatements</b>: as companies are expanding the management of their GHG
        footprint,
        better methodology and calculations are retroactively applied to past years, but usually without an additional
        third-party verification.
        <br>‚åõÔ∏è<b>GHG reporting is still issued very late compared to financial information</b>. Most climate reporting
        are
        issued 6
        to 9 months after the closing of the reporting period. A few companies started dislosing estimates with
        disclaimers.
        <br>üìä<b>Scope 3 reporting is still very unstable and heterogeneous</b>. In general, more categories are
        added
        and verified but normalization and good understanding of full value chain performance will remain challenging
        until we get
        confident about the comprehensiveness of scope 3 reporting. Supplier engagement initiatives are increasing
        though.
