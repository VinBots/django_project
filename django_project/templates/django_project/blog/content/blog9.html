        <h2>Better consistency, comparability and reliability</h2>

        <p> New York, June 2022 - If adopted, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the proposed SEC rules</a> related to climate-related
            disclosures will
            significantly enhance consistency,
            comparability and reliability of climate data and risks for almost 7,000 companies in the US. Only a few
            days left (until June 17) for public comments.
        <h3>Let's start with my Top 5 positives ❤️</h3>
        <br>💡 On top of scope 1 and 2 emissions, <b>scope 3 emissions</b> will have to be disclosed if material or if a
        company has
        committed to a GHG emissions reduction target that includes scope 3. This is a very smart way to mandate
        scope 3
        reporting, clarify the scope of net zero commitments for a lot of companies and keep them accountable.
        <br> 📊 Most of <b>GHG protocol</b> is adopted but not fully: in particular, companies will be required to align
        with the accounting
        principles of the financial reporting : same fiscal year period, same historical periods, same
        organizational boundary
        as the consolidated statements… so that analysis of financial and climate performance can be analyzed
        together
        consistently.
        <br> 📆 The <b>timing of GHG disclosures</b> will have to align with financial reporting, so companies will have
        to
        either track GHG
        emissions on a quarterly basis or rely on estimates (SEC notes that if actual reported data is not
        reasonably available,
        a company will be permitted to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal
        quarter). Today,
        most companies only report on an annual basis with 6-9 months delay compared to financial results
        disclosures.
        <br> 📚 The structure (articulated around governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and target) and
        content of
        disclosures (e.g. physical vs. transition risks) are based on <b>TCFD framework</b>, like ISSB, which is
        excellent
        news.
        Disclosures of targets, transition plan, progress vs. plan, associated expenditures (expensed and
        capitalized costs),
        internal carbon price, uses of carbon offsets and RECs (incl. costs), scenario analysis (if used) will
        promote
        transparency and peer benchmarking.
        ✒ <b>Limited assurance</b> (similar to the quality of a financial review) from 2024/2025 and <b>reasonable
            assurance</b>
        (similar to a
        financial audit) from 2026/2027 will be required for the disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of
        large companies.
        Smaller reporting companies are exempt.
        <br><br>
        <h3>...and the Top 5 negatives 🤔</h3>
        <br>🌂 Scope 3 disclosures benefit from a <b>“safe harbor”</b> mechanism, limiting liability exposures. Let’s
        hope this
        will be
        removed soon, at least for the largest companies.
        <br>📅 First mandatory climate-related reporting is expected in 2024. This is <b>too late</b> given the climate
        urgency
        (a good
        reminder that SEC mission is not to address climate-related issues but protect investors, maintain fair and
        efficient
        markets and promote capital formation).
        <br>📉 <b>Scenario analysis</b> is not mandated (yet) but required to be disclosed if used. This is an essential
        tool
        for risk
        management that should be integrated in the future.
        <br>❓No specific methodology is prescribed for <b>financed emissions</b> (category 15 in scope 3), which will
        leave
        (too) much flexibility for financial institutions to report on their scope 3 emissions.
        <br>💲I am concerned that in the current economic context, the <b>additional compliance costs</b>, estimated at
        about
        $500k per year, will delay the adoption of this proposed regulation or weaken it.
