            Last summer 2021, I embarked on a wonderful but long adventure : analyzing the climate performance of
            the top 100 American companies by scanning through their website, sustainability reporting, CDP
            disclosures, verification report and updates about their progress to date. Because there is no public
            repository of carbon footprint and climate targets, I had no choice but to manually investigate every
            single company based on its public data. I collected over a thousand documents and captured millions of
            data points that I intend to make publicly-available on the net0tracker website. My objective was to get
            a feel of the state of climate reporting and quantitatively benchmark different companies in their
            climate disclosures and performance.

            Here's the 10 best practices to improve transparency:
        <ol>

            <li><b>Provide comprehensive scope 3 footprint data</b>: many companies calculate but do not publish scope 3
                data in
                their
                sustainability report, probably because of lack of verification or trust. Many companies also
                misrepresent
                the
                total scope 3 footprint by only including a few categories (typically business travel and commute).</li>
            <li><b>Provide all the details of your climate commitments</b>: reduction targets, baseline, scopes,
                exclusions
                and pace of reduction by year. The formulation adopted by SBTi is a good start.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Do not merge scopes or categories</b>: GHG protocol define 3 scopes and specific scope 3 categories for carbon accounting.
                Some
                companies merge some scopes (e.g. scope 1 and 2) or some categories without providing the details.
            </li>
            <li><b>Make the verification report publicly-available</b>: <b>35%</b> companies claim that their climate
                data is
                verified but do not provide the verification report.</li>
            <li><b>Avoid or verify prior year restatements</b>: some companies restate their prior year GHG data, often
                because of change of methodology, but often fail at making them re-verified by an external
                third-party.</li>
            <li><b>Make GHG data consistent with CDP report</b>: there are still many discrepancies between public
                reporting
                and CDP report because of periods, scopes or restatements.</li>
            <li><b>Make CDP report publicly-available</b>: <b>63%</b> companies provide their CDP report. Since CDP
                requires to
                create an account and impose quotas on number of companies to search for, a simple link to the CDP
                website is not enough to demonstrate transparency.</li>
            <li><b>Provide the latest CDP questionnaire</b>, even if not available yet on CDP website. The most advanced
                companies (<b>14%</b>) share their 2021 submissions even if 2021 scores are not published yet. I also
                encourage companies that submit for the first time to CDP (e.g. Netflix, Facebook) to share their CDP
                questionnaire</li>
            <li><b>Publish your climate data in a timely manner</b>: in general, companies report their carbon footprint
                6
                to 12 months after the closing period, which is still way too late.</li>
            <li><b>Regularly report on your progress</b>: report on your progress at least on quarterly basis and
                provide guidance on the
                achievement of your commitments.</li>
        </ol>
