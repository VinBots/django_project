        <h3>Net Zero: The Next Frontier for Corporate Sustainability</h3>
        <p><span class="image left"><img width="50" src="{% static 'django_project/articles/net0_frontier2.png' %}"

            When it comes to climate change, the science is unequivocal: global temperatures will continue to rise for
            decades, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. This will have catastrophic effects
            on human health, infrastructure, energy, agriculture, fisheries, sea levels, natural ecosystems, and more.
            For many, the consequences have felt distant and theoretical — until now. Unprecedented wildfires, the
            world’s first climate-induced war in Syria, PG&E’s climate-fueled bankruptcy, devastating hurricanes, and
            deadly heatwaves — among a litany of other environmental, social, and economic disasters — have changed
            this. Following the US’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, it is up to corporations to take
            direct responsibility for their impact on climate change.

            While many corporations, investors, regulators, and consumers agree that corporate sustainability is
            imperative, identifying best practices and which companies are ‘walking the walk’ can be challenging.
            Corporate metrics, certifications, and coalitions abound, including the Sustainable Accounting Standards
            Bureau (SASB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), the Task
            Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the Renewable Energy 100
            (RE100), the Business Roundtable, B Corps, and benefit corporations. Greenwashing — a form of marketing that
            creates a false perception of a company’s environmental sustainability — exacerbates this confusion.
